# Module6-RDBMS

Add 2 pdf files with 3 models of DB.
Add txt file with SQL script of creating DB according to physical model.
Add screenshot of MySql workbench after executing Sql script.

During creation these models, I used separate tables to manage relations between main tables. 
These separate tables consist of foreign keys.
